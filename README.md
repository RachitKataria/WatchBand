# WatchBand â€“ A real-time musical immersion into the Apple ecosystem that revives the air guitar of the past

WatchBand is a musical adventure through Apple's wearable and product ecosystem. Using Apple Watches, users can strum, drum, and saxophone to the beat of their favorite tunes. With real-time motion tracking of both the Apple Watch and Siri remote, users are truly in control of the musical experience at their fingertips. You have the option of choosing songs from multiple genres.

Used WatchKit and CoreMotion frameworks to measure real-time accelerometer data of the Apple Watch and Siri Remote 

Worked on and finished this project at Stanford's TreeHacks 2016.
